Here, I include tutorials that help me remember how I did something or get something, and that could help others as well.
Phylo-PopGen-analyses-R: Phylogenetics and Population Genetics in R (a primer). In this tutorial, students will learn fundamental phylogenetic and population genetics analyses using DNA sequences in the programming language R.
Coords_DNAseqs: Tutorial to retrieve the geographic coordinates associated with published DNA sequences in the form of geographic coordinates: Latitude and Longitude (e.g., Lat = 35.0775, Lon = -106.6625).
range_maps_IUCN: A small tutorial on downloading species range maps from IUCN. This is a minimal tutorial on how to access the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) range maps of species directly from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species portal: https://www.iucnredlist.org.
Tutorial_BEAST_LA: This tutorial was prepared in Spanish using Microsoft Windows. The tutorial starts with downloading BEAST2 and finishes with obtaining a maximum clade credibility tree visualized in Figtree.
